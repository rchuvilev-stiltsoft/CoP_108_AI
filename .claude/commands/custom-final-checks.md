# Pre-PR custom checks

## Overview
I have current branch code and master branch code of the project and I am going to do final checks and improvements before PR.

## Instructions
Please reset context, re-analyze code base of the project.â€¨Then check the diff of files between current version and master branch.
Please fix and improve if possible the diffed and related files to follow the best practices, reusing code duplications with constants and utility methods, improving code architecture and clean code concepts. Remove unused code where possible. Do it without touching files not involved directly in the diff, creating new and deleting existing ones when not requested. Do not create new files or change project file structure.
Also not use comments, the readable naming of variables and methods is more preferable.
Do updates with possible improvements mentioned and providing clean and readable code.
Do heuristic check of changes to be sure they are not causing new issues. Do fixes if needed.
Finally provide overview of per-file/method changes made in terms of the improvements applied.
